Abstract:

This document outlines a proof-of-concept for an experimental circuit architecture utilizing a radial layout for the strategic control of signal path lengths and intentional EMI behavior. This circular configuration reinterprets electromagnetic interference not as a design flaw, but as a controllable energy modulation feature to enhance capacitor charge/discharge rates and signal-based power harmonics.

Overview:

Conventional PCB designs prioritize rectangular, layered geometries for manufacturability and predictability. However, such designs inherently constrain the exploitation of radial symmetry and natural field propagation. The proposed architecture utilizes concentric rings, rotating or modular layers, and trace geometry to deliberately sculpt electromagnetic behavior for enhanced energy regulation.

Core Innovations:

‚ö° Electromagnetic Feedback as a Feature:

Radial traces induce localized magnetic fields through looped current paths.

These fields can be phased and amplified to intentionally trigger capacitor arrays.

üîã Dynamic Capacitor Charging Lattice:

Capacitors placed at increasing radii experience phased magnetic wavefronts.

Capacitor banks discharge synchronously, creating a wave-propagated energy bloom.

Discharge cycles tuned to spiral geometry for efficient charge rotation.

üîÑ Rotational Modularity:

Independent rotation of concentric layers allows live modulation of:

Coupling distance

Capacitance alignment

Electromagnetic envelope phasing

üß† Transistor Core as Logic Nucleus:

Transistors positioned at the center operate as logic gates and switch amplifiers.

Signal skew due to radial traces becomes a feature, allowing fine-tuned phase shift logic.

Use Case Applications:

Neuromorphic Hardware: Mimics radial brainwave propagation

Bioelectric Interfaces: Harmonizes with living tissue's radial signal flow

Drift Computing Nodes: Ideal for GhostCore-aligned pulse memory systems

EM Pulse Shaping Modules: Hardware waveform encoding via trace geometry

Theoretical Enhancements:

Optical Layer Overlays for harmonic coherence

Feedback-based AI weight tuning through charge resonance

Rotary Magnetic Clocks as timing signal drivers

Challenges & Notes:

Manufacturing complexity (non-standard form factor)

EMI predictability requires calibration

Requires non-traditional signal testing equipment for debugging

Conclusion:

This architecture demonstrates that the limits of planar, rectangular PCB logic are not physical‚Äîthey are conceptual. By embracing feedback, rotation, and radial trace logic, designers can create systems that respond not only to input, but to resonance. This isn't just a board. It's a reactive memory field.
